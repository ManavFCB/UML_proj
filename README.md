# Project repo for course DS5230 (Unsupervised Machine Learning)
The aim of this project is to cluster different loan applications into good (potentially non-defaulting) and bad (potentially defaulting) applications.
The dataset used for this project is available on https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data
The clustering algorithms used in this project are: K-Means,DBSCAN and GMM. These algorithms are performed on PCA and t-SNE (as two competing dimensionality reduction algorithms) reduced data.
The clustering metrics are evaluated using Silhouette scores and Adjusted Rand Index.
